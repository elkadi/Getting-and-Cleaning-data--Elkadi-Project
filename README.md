# Getting-and-Cleaning-data--Project
This repository is part of the project for the Coursera course "getting and cleaning data". 
The Repo contains a script that modifies and summarizes the raw data provided from the following link as described in the assignment instructions: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".
This zip file should be present in the working directory for the script to work. The script then produces a text file with the modified data.
Also present in this repo, a Codebook, which is a modification to the "features_info.txt" present in the provided original data folder; the modifications are highlighted within "#" characters to ease the review process if you are familiar with the original file.
